# OpenEval Lab - Advanced Implementation Summary

## üéØ Implementation Overview

We have successfully implemented **4 major advanced features** that bring OpenEval Lab to state-of-the-art standards, following patterns from leading evaluation frameworks like lm-evaluation-harness and OpenAI evals.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Jinja2 Prompt Templating System** (Commit: 6232603)
- **PromptTemplate class** with auto-detection and common templates
- **Task integration** for flexible prompt engineering
- **Custom filters** (e.g., `alpha` for A/B/C/D conversion)
- **CLI support** with template rendering in `write_out` command
- **Comprehensive tests** and example specifications

**Impact**: Enables sophisticated prompt engineering with variables, loops, and conditionals, matching industry standards.

### 2. **Log-Likelihood Multiple-Choice Evaluation** (Commit: 1b5d0fa)
- **MultipleChoiceTask** and **MCQATask** for robust evaluation
- **LogLikelihoodAdapter protocol** with mock implementation
- **LogLikelihoodAccuracy metric** for scoring
- **Length normalization** to handle answer bias
- **MCQADataset** with proper example structure
- **Comprehensive testing** and example workflows

**Impact**: Provides robust multiple-choice evaluation using model probabilities rather than string matching, following lm-evaluation-harness patterns.

### 3. **Code Execution Metric with pass@k** (Commit: 6b77e7f)
- **CodeExecutionMetric** and **HumanEvalMetric** for code evaluation
- **Safe subprocess execution** with timeout handling
- **Proper pass@k calculation** following HumanEval standards
- **CodeDataset** and **HumanEvalDataset** for code tasks
- **Error handling** and execution statistics
- **Multi-test case support** with comprehensive reporting

**Impact**: Enables robust evaluation of code generation models using actual execution, supporting industry-standard metrics like pass@1, pass@10, pass@100.

### 4. **Curated Task Library with Benchmark Suites** (Commit: 892e0c6)
- **TaskLibrary** with pre-configured standard evaluation tasks
- **8 curated tasks** across 5 categories (QA, multiple-choice, code, summarization, benchmarks)
- **BenchmarkSuite** for running multiple related tasks
- **CLI integration** for library interaction (list, info, export, categories)
- **Search and filtering** capabilities
- **Import/export functionality** for custom tasks

**Impact**: Provides easy access to standard benchmarks without manual configuration, enabling rapid evaluation and comparison.
